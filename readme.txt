Project Title : DFS vs BFS

Description :
This drill is about testing the Depth First Search(DFS) algorithm and Breadth First Search(BFS) algorithm. Basically, they have to find vertices that
Depth First Search (DFS) visits before Breadth First Search in graph traversal. Additionally,Both Depth First Search(DFS) and Breadth First Search(BFS) 
algorithms break ties in alphabetical order.

Dependencies :
-Python3
-Python Libraries used:
	random,string,sys,matplotlib,networkx,os
