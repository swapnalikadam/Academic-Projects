Project Title: DFS vs BFS

Description :
This drill tests the Depth First Search(DFS) and Breadth First Search(BFS) algorithms. Basically, the implemented algorithm  finds vertices that Depth First Search (DFS) visits before Breadth First Search in graph traversal. Additionally, Both Depth First Search(DFS) and Breadth First Search(BFS)  algorithms break ties alphabetically.

Dependencies :
-Python3
-Python Libraries used: random, string, sys, matplotlib, network, os
