# Academic-Projects
The Academic Projects repository includes projects from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the latest technologies like React.js, MongoDB, and Docker for cloud storage. 
Some projects explored Data Visualization in Machine Learning, employing Python and libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas for insightful visualizations.
This repository is organized with branches representing different projects, aligning with my goal to structure each branch as a distinct project. This approach results in fewer repositories, each dedicated to a specific purpose or intention behind its creation with its readme file for details of each project as a branch. Furthermore, each branch has its own README file, providing detailed information about the corresponding project.
