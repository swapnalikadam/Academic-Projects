This React.js application facilitates a university printing service with user authentication, catering to two distinct user roles: students and university professors. Upon login using their respective IDs and passwords, users gain role-specific access controls within the university Printing Service.

Once authenticated, users can conveniently upload files for printing. The uploaded files are automatically stored on a cloud storage system referred to as Docker. Notably, if users wish to print the same document again, there's no need to re-upload the file. The previously saved file on the cloud can be readily utilized, streamlining the process, preserving user authentication, and preventing an overload of printing requests on the facility. This approach not only saves users time but also contributes to the efficient management of the university's printing resources.
