# Implementing Relational Algebra queries in B plus Tree

This project was undertaken for the RDBMS course, focusing on SQL database concepts. The primary goal was to build a hypothetical database system using Python. The system incorporates simplified versions of three essential relational algebra operations: select, project, and join. Additionally, it includes a limited form of a B+_tree index and various utility functions.

For a detailed understanding of the functions created and their specific functionalities, you can review the "report_svkadam" file. This document serves as a comprehensive guide, offering a list and detailed descriptions of all the implemented functions within the project.
