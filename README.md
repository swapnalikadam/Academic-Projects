I employed Python visualizations with Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to analyze landscaping company data efficiently. Pandas facilitated seamless data handling and cleaning, while NumPy enhanced numerical operations. For visualizations, I turned to Seaborn, simplifying the creation of insightful plots. This approach revealed data patterns, optimized company performance, assessed customer satisfaction, identified improvement areas, analyzed employee efficiency, and explored the correlation between employee performance and company growth.
